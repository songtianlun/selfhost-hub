# About SelfHost Hub

SelfHost Hub is a platform dedicated to collecting and showcasing various self-hosted services, aimed at helping users discover, compare, and choose open-source self-hosted solutions that fit their needs.

## Our Mission

We believe everyone should have the right to control their own data and services. Through self-hosting, users can:

- Maintain complete control over personal and business data
- Customize services according to their own needs
- Be free from restrictions imposed by third-party service providers
- Learn and understand how technology works
- Contribute to the open-source community

The mission of SelfHost Hub is to make self-hosting easier by providing a comprehensive resource directory, helping more people embark on their self-hosting journey.

## What We Offer

- **Curated Service Directory**: We carefully select various self-hosted services, including web applications, tools, platforms, and more
- **Detailed Information**: Each service includes detailed descriptions, key features, deployment requirements, and use cases
- **Categories and Tags**: Quickly find services that meet your needs through our category and tag system
- **Multilingual Support**: Providing content in both Chinese and English to meet the needs of different users

## How to Contribute

SelfHost Hub is an open-source project, and we welcome community contributions:

- **Add New Services**: Help us expand our service directory
- **Update Existing Information**: Keep service information accurate and up-to-date
- **Translate Content**: Help us provide support for more languages
