## What is SelfHost Hub?

SelfHost Hub is a platform dedicated to collecting and sharing quality self-hosted services and tools. Our goal is to help users discover self-hosted solutions that fit their needs, enabling everyone to take control of their data and services.

## Why Choose Self-Hosting?

In today's digital world, our data is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few large tech companies. Self-hosting allows you to:

- **Control your data**: No longer hand over personal information to third-party service providers.
- **Protect privacy**: Decide for yourself how your data is stored and used.
- **Customize your experience**: Adjust and configure services according to your needs.
- **Learn new skills**: Improve your technical abilities by deploying and maintaining services.
- **Lower costs**: Many self-hosted solutions are free or offer more flexible pricing models.

## Our Mission

The mission of SelfHost Hub is to:

1. **Collect and organize**: Find high-quality self-hosting tools and services, and provide detailed introductions and usage guides.
2. **Categorize and tag**: Help users quickly find solutions that meet specific needs through our category and tag system.
3. **Build community**: Establish an enthusiastic and helpful community that encourages knowledge sharing and mutual assistance.
4. **Raise awareness**: Let more people understand the benefits and possibilities of self-hosting.

## Contribute

SelfHost Hub is a community-driven project, and we welcome all forms of contribution:

- **Add new services**: If you know of a good self-hosted tool, feel free to submit it.
- **Improve content**: Help us improve descriptions, tags, and categories of existing services.
- **Translate**: Translate content into other languages to benefit more people.
- **Report issues**: If you find errors or have suggestions for improvement, please let us know.
